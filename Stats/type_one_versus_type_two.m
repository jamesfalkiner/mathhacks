%Type one versus type two errors

%Type one, when null hypothesis is rejected but it's actually correct. The
%significance level determines the percentage of cases you will mistakenly
%reject in this manner




%Unfortunately decreasing the number of type one errors often tends to increase the number of
%type two errors â€” accepting the null hypothesis when it should actually be rejected. As such,
%the significance level that is chosen is always trading off the rates of both type of error. The
%optimum significance level that results in the minimum number of errors overall is usually not
%known. Furthermore in some situations one type of error is more important than the other. For
%example, in the case of criminal investigations it is generally considered to be more important not
%to imprison an innocent person (a type one error if the null hypothesis is that they are innocent)
%than failing to imprison a guilty person (a type two error).
